 Data Disclaimer
The SEC company verification system allows users to check whether or not a company is registered with the SEC either as a corporation or as a partnership. The system also shows whether or not a company has the necessary secondary licenses to engage in investment-taking, lending, financing, and other regulated activities.

Please note that a company may not solicit investments from the public unless it has registered with the SEC as a corporation and has secured an Order of Registration of Securities and a Certificate of Permit to Sell Securities from the Commission. Meanwhile, a lending or financing company must first register as a corporation and secure a Certificate of Authority to Operate as a Lending or Financing Company before it can offer loans to the public.

The public may request copies of the company's Certificate of Incorporation, Order of Registration of Securities, Certificate of Permit to Sell Securities, or Certificate of Authority to Operate as a Lending or Financing Company, as the case may be, at secexpress.ph
