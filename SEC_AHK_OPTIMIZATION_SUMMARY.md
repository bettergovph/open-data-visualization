# SEC AHK Script Optimization Summary

## üéØ Current Issue
- **Total SEC Records**: 86 (incorrect count)
- **Actual Records**: 21 out of 2400+ (4 have no SEC data)
- **Next 25**: Ready in AHK for checking

## ‚ö° Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Minimal Tab Delays**
- **Before**: 200-300ms between tabs
- **After**: 50ms between tabs
- **Savings**: ~1.5 seconds per search

### 2. **Reduced Page Load Wait**
- **Before**: 3000ms (3 seconds)
- **After**: 2000ms (2 seconds)
- **Savings**: 1 second per search

### 3. **Optimized Enter Wait**
- **Before**: 8000ms (8 seconds) after search
- **After**: 2000ms (2 seconds) after Enter
- **Savings**: 6 seconds per search

### 4. **Optimized Focus Click**
- **Before**: `Click, 1, 1` with 500ms delay
- **After**: `Click, 1, 1` with 100ms delay (kept for focus)
- **Savings**: 400ms while maintaining proper focus

### 5. **Minimal Processing Delays**
- **Before**: 500ms after typing, 500ms after copy
- **After**: 100ms after typing, 100ms after copy
- **Savings**: 800ms per search

## üìä Performance Improvement

### Per Search Time Reduction
| Operation | Before | After | Savings |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Tab delays | 2.7s | 0.45s | 2.25s |
| Page load | 3s | 2s | 1s |
| Results wait | 8s | 2s | 6s |
| Processing | 1s | 0.2s | 0.8s |
| **Total per search** | **14.7s** | **4.65s** | **10.05s** |

### For 25 Contractors
- **Before**: 25 √ó 14.7s = **367.5 seconds (6.1 minutes)**
- **After**: 25 √ó 4.65s = **116.25 seconds (1.9 minutes)**
- **Total Savings**: **251.25 seconds (4.2 minutes)**

## üöÄ New Scripts Created

### 1. `sec_search_fast_optimized.ahk`
- **Purpose**: Main optimized script for processing contractors_next25.txt
- **Features**: All optimizations applied, handles complex company names
- **Usage**: Run this for the next 25 contractors

### 2. `sec_search_test_fast.ahk`
- **Purpose**: Test script with single company for validation
- **Features**: Same optimizations, single company test
- **Usage**: Test the optimizations before running full batch

## üîß Key Changes Made

### Tab Navigation
```ahk
; BEFORE
Loop, 9 {
    Send, {Tab}
    Sleep, 300  ; 300ms delay
}

; AFTER
Loop, 9 {
    Send, {Tab}
    Sleep, 50   ; 50ms delay - 6x faster
}
```

### Focus Click (IMPORTANT)
```ahk
; BEFORE
Click, 1, 1    ; Focus click
Sleep, 500     ; 500ms delay

; AFTER
Click, 1, 1    ; Focus click (kept!)
Sleep, 100     ; 100ms delay - 5x faster
```

### Search Execution
```ahk
; BEFORE
Send, {Space}  ; Mouse click simulation
Sleep, 8000    ; 8 second wait

; AFTER
Send, {Enter}  ; Direct keyboard
Sleep, 2000    ; 2 second wait - 4x faster
```

### Page Load
```ahk
; BEFORE
Sleep, 3000    ; 3 second wait

; AFTER
Sleep, 2000    ; 2 second wait - 33% faster
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Speed Improvement
- **68% faster** per search
- **4.2 minutes saved** for 25 contractors
- More reliable execution (no mouse dependencies)

### Reliability
- **Maintained focus click** - ensures proper window focus
- **Reduced wait times** - less chance of timeouts
- **Minimal delays** - faster overall processing
- **Keyboard navigation** - more consistent after focus

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Test First
1. Run `sec_search_test_fast.ahk` to verify optimizations work
2. Check results in `SEC_SearchResults_FAST.txt`
3. Confirm timing improvements

### Run Full Batch
1. Ensure `contractors_next25.txt` is ready
2. Run `sec_search_fast_optimized.ahk`
3. Monitor progress in tooltip
4. Results saved in `sec_results_next25/` directory

## üîç Monitoring

### Progress Tracking
- Tooltip shows current contractor being processed
- File naming includes clean company names
- Error handling for failed searches

### Expected Output
- Individual result files for each contractor
- Consistent naming convention
- Complete search results with metadata

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Optimized for Microsoft Edge (`msedge.exe`)
- Uses `Chrome_WidgetWin_1` window class
- May need adjustment for other browsers

### Network Considerations
- 2-second waits assume good network connection
- May need adjustment for slower connections
- Retry logic still in place for failed attempts

### SEC Website Changes
- Tab count (9 tabs) may need adjustment if SEC site changes
- Monitor for any layout changes that affect navigation

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the optimized script** with single company
2. **Run full batch** for next 25 contractors
3. **Monitor results** for accuracy and speed
4. **Adjust delays** if needed based on results
5. **Update SEC record count** in your system

The optimized scripts should significantly reduce the time needed to collect SEC data for your remaining contractors!
