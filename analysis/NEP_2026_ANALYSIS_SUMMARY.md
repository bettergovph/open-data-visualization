# NEP 2026 Analysis: Flood Control Baseline Pattern Comparison

**Generated:** $(date)  
**Analysis Type:** Pattern-based anomaly detection using flood control scheme as baseline

---

## Executive Summary

Using the known flood control budget scheme patterns as a baseline, we analyzed NEP 2026 (proposed budget) against actual Budget history (2020-2025) to identify similar suspicious patterns.

### üî¥ **Key Finding: Road Infrastructure Shows Flood-Like Pattern**

**Risk Level: HIGH** 

NEP 2026 exhibits a **61.9% increase** in road infrastructure spending compared to historical average (2020-2025), exceeding the flood control baseline threshold of 50% YoY growth.

## Flood Control Baseline Pattern (Reference)

The following metrics were extracted from actual flood control data showing the Bulacan clustering scheme:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Geographic Clustering** | 60% in 3 provinces | Manila, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac concentration |
| **Sudden Rise (Bulacan)** | +118% (2022‚Üí2023) | Bulacan flood control spike |
| **Typical YoY Growth** | +81% | Flood control typical growth rate |
| **Alert Threshold** | ‚â•50% YoY | Growth rate indicating suspicious pattern |
| **Cost Disparity** | 2.6x ratio | Urban (‚Ç±54M) vs Rural (‚Ç±20M) average |
| **Budget Clustering** | 74% | Projects mapped to systematic budget lines |

### Bulacan Flood Control Pattern (2020-2024):
- **2020**: 13 projects, ‚Ç±668M (Davao del Sur)
- **2021**: 51 projects, ‚Ç±3.2B (+292%)
- **2022**: 145 projects in Bulacan, ‚Ç±7.8B (+184%)
- **2023**: 263 projects in Bulacan, ‚Ç±17.0B (**+118%** ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **2024**: 248 projects in Bulacan, ‚Ç±18.2B (+7%)

| Year | Total Budget | YoY Growth | Pattern Match |
|------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2020 | ‚Ç±128.6M | baseline | N/A |
| 2021 | ‚Ç±4.51B | +3405.1%* | ‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly (data issue) |
| 2022 | ‚Ç±5.02B | +11.5% | Normal |
| 2023 | ‚Ç±5.27B | +4.9% | Normal |
| 2024 | ‚Ç±5.77B | +9.5% | Normal |
| 2025 | ‚Ç±6.33B | +9.7% | Normal |
| **2026** | **‚Ç±6.79B** | **+7.4%** | **Normal** |

*Note: 2021 spike likely due to incomplete 2020 data*

**Finding:** Overall NEP 2026 budget growth is **normal** and does not match flood control sudden rise pattern.

### 2. Geographic Clustering Analysis

| Metric | Budget 2025 | NEP 2026 | Flood Baseline |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Top 3 Concentration** | 87.9% | **27.2%** | 60% threshold |
| **Top Regions** | 1, 3, 2 | 13, 03, 05 | Manila, N. Ecija, Tarlac |

**Finding:** NEP 2026 shows **LOWER** geographic clustering than flood baseline. This is **positive** - budget is more evenly distributed.

## Risk Assessment

## Interpretation

### What the Pattern Means

The flood control scheme showed these characteristics:
1. **Sudden spike** in spending (+118% in one year)
2. **Geographic concentration** in one province (Bulacan)
3. **Systematic budget allocation** with high clustering

### NEP 2026 Comparison

‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Overall budget growth is normal (+7.4%)
- Geographic distribution is MORE even than flood baseline (27.2% vs 60%)
- Flood control spending growth is below threshold (+33.6%)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Flag:**
- **Road infrastructure** shows sudden spike (+61.9%) similar to flood control pattern

### Context

Unlike the flood control scheme which showed:
- Geographic concentration in Bulacan (60%+ in 3 provinces)
- Massive year-over-year spikes (+118%)
- Systematic project bundling

NEP 2026 shows:
- Better geographic distribution
- Normal overall growth
- **ONE CATEGORY (roads) with suspicious growth**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Deep Dive into Road Infrastructure Budget**
   - Identify specific line items with largest increases
   - Map to actual road projects and locations
   - Analyze geographic distribution of road projects
   - Review justifications for 61.9% increase

2. **Contractor Analysis**
   - Identify contractors for road infrastructure projects
   - Check for concentration patterns
   - Review bid processes and awards

3. **Needs Assessment**
   - Compare road infrastructure allocation against:
     - Actual road conditions and maintenance needs
     - Historical project completion rates
     - Infrastructure gap analysis
   - Validate if 61.9% increase is justified by actual needs

4. **Regional Distribution**
   - Break down road infrastructure by region
   - Check for Bulacan-like concentration in specific provinces
   - Identify beneficiary regions and justifications

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Budget Database:** Actual government budgets 2020-2025
- **NEP Database:** Proposed NEP 2026 budget
- **Flood Control Data:** DPWH flood control projects 2020-2024
- **Correlation Data:** Budget-flood correlation analysis

### Analysis Approach
1. Extract baseline metrics from known flood control scheme
2. Query Budget history (2020-2025) for comparison data
3. Query NEP 2026 proposed budget
4. Calculate year-over-year growth rates
5. Compare against flood control thresholds
6. Identify pattern matches

### Keywords Used
- **Flood Control:** flood, drainage, pumping, estero, river control, creek, dike
- **Road Infrastructure:** road, bridge, highway
- **Water Systems:** water, irrigation, dam, canal
- **Building Construction:** building, construction, facility

---

## Limitations

1. **2020 Data Anomaly:** Budget 2020 shows only ‚Ç±128.6M total, suggesting incomplete data. This causes the 2021 spike of +3405%, which should be disregarded.

2. **Schema Differences:** Budget 2017-2019 have different database schemas and were excluded from analysis.

3. **Column Mapping:** Budget tables use `dsc` (description) and `amt` (amount) while NEP uses `description` and `amount`. Geographic coding differs (Budget uses `agency`, NEP uses `region_code`).

4. **Keyword Limitations:** Infrastructure categorization relies on keyword matching, which may miss some projects or create false positives.

5. **Proposed vs Actual:** NEP 2026 is **proposed** budget, not yet enacted. Patterns may change during legislative deliberation.

---

## Conclusion

While NEP 2026 does NOT exhibit the full flood control scheme pattern (no geographic concentration, normal overall growth), it shows **ONE SIGNIFICANT RED FLAG**:

> **Road infrastructure spending increases by 61.9%** compared to historical average, exceeding the flood control pattern threshold of 50% YoY growth.

This warrants detailed investigation to determine if:
1. The increase is justified by actual infrastructure needs
2. There is geographic concentration similar to Bulacan flood control pattern
3. Contractor selection shows concerning patterns
4. Budget allocation methodology is systematic/clustered

**Recommendation:** Conduct detailed audit of NEP 2026 road infrastructure allocations, focusing on geographic distribution, project justifications, and contractor patterns.
